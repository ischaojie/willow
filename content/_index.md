Hello, Willow is a theme designed for the static site generator tool [zola](https://www.getzola.org/). Without beautiful components like [Tabler](https://github.com/tabler/tabler), Willow would not exist. Thanks to Tabler and other third-party libraries, thank you for open source!

Some main features of Willow:
- Common blog functions such as article lists, tag pages, about pages, RSS feeds, etc.
- Supports the [giscus](https://giscus.app/) commenting system.
- Supports photography portfolio pages (likes support coming soon).
- Supports [memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos) feature.

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the [README](https://github.com/ischaojie/willow/). If you have any questions, feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/ischaojie/willow/issues).
